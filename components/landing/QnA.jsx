    question: "What is Virtual Try-On?",
    answer:
      "Virtual Try-On allows you to see how clothes will look on a model without needing to try them on physically.<br />We achieve this by using an advanced AI model that weâ€™ve trained with high-quality images.<br />This AI generates realistic images of clothes on models, saving you the hassle and cost of traditional photoshoots.",

    question: "How does it work?",
    answer:
      "You simply need to upload pictures of the clothes, and we take care of the rest!<br />You can select the fashion model and the body position you desire.<br />Then, we provide the image of the model wearing the clothes you uploaded.",
